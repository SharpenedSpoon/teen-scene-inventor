LED Fighting

Purpose:
	This program is a "game" sort of I guess. There is a line of LEDs in a row,
	with a button on either side. When you press a button, it will "push" light
	towards the other side.

Hardware:
	* Two buttons connected to pins 1 and 2 (corresponding to player 1 and player 2!)
	* 6 LEDs, connected to pins 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
	* Player 1's button should be on the side with LED 5, and Player 2 should be on the opposite side

int currentPlayerSide = 1; // this keeps track of which side the LEDs have been pushed to

	pinMode(playerTwoPin, INPUT);

		pinMode(currentLedPin, OUTPUT); // set pin mode to output
	}

	// ----- Turn off all lights (to reset and prep them)
	for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
		int currentLedPin = ledPins[i]; // sets currentLedPin to be the i'th number in the ledPins array
		digitalWrite(currentLedPin, LOW); // turn off the LED
	}
}

	// ----- Gets the state of each button (remember, LOW means the button is pushed)
