{"name":"Teen-scene-inventor","tagline":"","body":"# Teen Scene 2014 Inventor\r\n===================\r\n\r\n## What this is\r\nIn 2014, I taught a week long summer class to a group of teenagers wherein they learned and experimented with Arduinos - both the hardware and software side of things. This repository is meant mostly for them, as a loose collection of links for more information, as well as a handful of scripts that might help them get started creating.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nFirstly, let me say that if you are interested in the Arduino, then you are in luck - it is definitely one of the most popular microcontrollers out there, and there is a vast wealth of resources on the web. These might not be the best resources, but they will hopefully get you started!\r\n\r\n* Sparkfun (<https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/103>)\r\n  * This is a very newbie-friendly online shop for Arduino parts, kits, and components.\r\n  * There is some talk online that this is not the cheapest resource. In fact, for some small components (say, a few LEDs or resistors here and there) you might even check out physical stores like RadioShack (remember RadioShack? Yeah, they're still around). However, from my personal experience I know that it is hard to find a good all-in-one resource online to buy things, so Sparkfun provides this.\r\n  * This is the Arudino kit we used: <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001> and I highly reccomend it, even if you feel you are \"done\" with it just because we have gone through the circuits included in the book. I will likely buy this myself after the class is over - I especially like the breadboard and Arduino holder that it coms with.\r\n  * Alternately, you might look into something like this: <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BT0NDB8/> which is a similar kit, but uses an \"official\" arduino board which can have its individual chips repaired. That is, if you \"fry your board\" with this kit, you could (in theory) replace the fried chip for a few dollars, rather than buying a new Arduino board for ~$25.\r\n\r\n* Vendors (where to buy Arduino and parts)\r\n  * Amazon (<http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=arduino&sprefix=arduin%2Caps&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aarduino>)\r\n  * Sparkfun (<https://www.sparkfun.com/>)\r\n  * Adafruit (<http://www.adafruit.com/>)\r\n  * Seeed Studio (<http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/>)\r\n  * Misc. Large Scale vendors (<http://octopart.com/partsearch#!?q=arduino>)\r\n\r\n* Tutorials (Hardware-focused)\r\n  * <http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations>\r\n  * <http://makerzone.mathworks.com/>\r\n  * <http://www.instructables.com/index>\r\n  * <http://hacknmod.com/>\r\n* Tutorials (Software-focused)\r\n  * <http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage>\r\n  * <http://makerzone.mathworks.com/>\r\n* Other Lists of Tutorials\r\n  * <http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/fhdsd/arduino_tutorials_list/>\r\n  * <http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/Resources>\r\n  * <http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/11-great-arduino-resources.html>\r\n* Books\r\n  * Getting Started with Arduino (Make: Projects)\r\n  * 30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius\r\n  * 30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius\r\n  * Arduino Cookbook\r\n* Videos\r\n  * There are many, many video tutorials on MAKE, Instructables, and YouTube - they all have their strengths and weaknesses!\r\n\r\n* Online circuit simulator\r\n  * <http://www.falstad.com/circuit/> This is a little bit obtuse, and not necessarily very user friendly - but it seems as though it's the only one that exists!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
